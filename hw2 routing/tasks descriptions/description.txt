Make an urls.py file that:
· directs the URL from home/' to the views.home method and sets the name for this URL as 'home-view';
· directs the URL from 'book/{chapter name}/' to the views method. Book along with the title of 
the chapter as the title argument and sets the name for this URL as 'book';
· passes requests starting with 'lesson_2/' to the 'lesson_2.urls' module along with the remainder of the URL.

Task 2:

·   directs the URL from 'index/' to the views.index method and sets the name for that URL as 'index-view'.
·   directs the URL from 'bio/{username}/' to the views.bio method with the username as the username argument and sets the name for this URL as 'bio'.

Task3:
1. Register on the Weather Open API website.
2. Get your APPID.
3. Make a test request and get the weather in your city, use GUIDE for it.
4. Add a /weather/?city=... route to your Django app.
5. Show a Django template with this info to the user.
6. If the city doesn't exist, show a warning to the current user using HttpResponse with the following text: City {city} does not exist!

You need to show the following information to the current user.
Your user can be from any country like Ukraine, USA, Canada, Italy, etc.
Let's imagine that frontend sends us some information about the user's city in the query params and we have to make a request using the "OpenWeather" API to get detailed info:
    * Country: ...
    * City: ...
    * Coords: ... (lon, lat)
    * Weather: ... (like Clouds e.t.c)
    * Temp: ... (convert it into Celsius)
